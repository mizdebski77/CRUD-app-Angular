## Introduction

Welcome to the CRUD App README! This application has been created as a part of a recruitment task. The purpose of the app is to demonstrate the ability to develop a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for campaign management. This app allows users to add, edit, and delete campaigns, along with various campaign details, and is designed to showcase proficiency in front-end development.

## Technologies Used

The CRUD App is built using the following technologies:

- **Angular**: A popular front-end framework for building dynamic web applications.
- **SCSS**: A powerful extension of CSS for adding style and design to the app.
- **JavaScript**: The primary scripting language used for interactivity.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.

## Installation

To set up the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/campaign-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd campaign-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
