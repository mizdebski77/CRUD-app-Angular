## Introduction

The application was developed as per the directive from Futurum Technology. Throughout the project, I collaborated with a seasoned Figma designer and a proficient backend developer. The link provided showcases the basic version of the application, as the complete version was exclusively delivered to the company. The purpose of the app is to demonstrate the ability to develop a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for campaign management.

## Technologies Used

The CRUD App is built using the following technologies:

- **Angular**: A popular front-end framework for building dynamic web applications.
- **SCSS**: A powerful extension of CSS for adding style and design to the app.
- **JavaScript**: The primary scripting language used for interactivity.
- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.

## Installation

To set up the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/campaign-app.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd campaign-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
